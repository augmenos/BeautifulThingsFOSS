# Beautiful Things Sample

This app presents a gallery of USDZ models in visionOS.
The app uses windows and ARQuickLook to present information.
Models can be searched, favorited, and dragged into a user's environment.

This sample app is open source, based on the original [Beautiful Things](https://beautifulthings.xyz) app and website.
The models are from Apple's [ARQuickLook page](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/quick-look/).
For more information about the app and how it works, refer to
the in-line documenation. You can also reach us with questions.
