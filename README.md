# Beautiful Things VisionOS App Template

The Beautiful Things App Template is a free and open source software (FOSS) app template for visionOS to present a gallery of 3d models. 

Designed as an extension of the [Beautiful Things](https://beautifulthings.xyz) website, the app uses windows and AR Quick Look to present information. 3D Models can be searched, favorited, and dragged into a user's environment.

## Why would I use this?
* **Jumpstart Your Project** → Leverage the power of USDZ + ARQuickLook to power your VisionOS app.
* **Speed and Simplicity** → Ideal for rapid app creation without compromising on quality.
* **Learning Opportunity** → If you're delving into VisionOS app development, this template is a perfect starting point. 

For more information about the app and how it works, refer to the in-line documenation. You can also reach us with questions. If you use this template, please contribute to this repo as you build cool Things with it.
